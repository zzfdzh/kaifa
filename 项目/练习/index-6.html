            <p> Take the advantage of next and third generation
                sequencing, more and more woody genomes have been
                sequenced, including Populus and Betula. However,
                due to lack of bioinformatics background, the utilization
                of is not very successful. Under such circumstance,
                we collected the data sets of the published tree genomes
                and developed an easy-to-use platform for biologists
                without bioinformatics skills or computing resources.
                The tree genomic analysis platform (TGAP) a database
                and analysis platform for genomic and biological information
                of trees. TGAP includes a RNA-seq analysis pipeline
                containing the following functions: quality control
                of the sequencing reads, alignment of reads to the
                transcripts references, identification of differentially
                expressed genes (DEGs), GO enrichment analysis for the DEGs,
                cluster for the DEGs, co-expression analysis for the DEGs,
                motif enrichment for the DEGs. In addition to the RNA-seq
                analysis pipeline, TGAP also provides a lot of useful tools
                for genome analysis, such as BLAST analysis, multiple sequence
                alignment, retrieve of genomic sequence, CAP3 assembler,
                reverse complement of sequence. User can download all the
                genome data sets from TGAP.
